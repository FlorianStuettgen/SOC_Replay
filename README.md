SOC_Replay is an offline Python engine for testing detection rules against stored security events. It connects each result to the input events, rule logic, and verification checks that produced it, then packages that evidence so another reviewer can reproduce it.

The engineering problem is broader than security: a result becomes more useful when its inputs, assumptions, and transformations can be inspected. This project demonstrates that discipline through deterministic replay, exact expected outcomes, and explicit limits on what the evidence establishes.

**Start here:** [Inspect a result without installing](reference/network-scan/report.md) · [Run the demo](#quickstart) · [Review the engineering decisions](docs/16-Engineering-Review.md) · [Check implementation state](docs/14-Implementation-State.md)

## Why this matters

| Review question | Evidence in this project | Relevance to data and controls work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where did the result come from? | Input hashes, rule fingerprints, and event-level detection evidence | Trace a reported exception back to its source and transformation logic |
| Can another person reproduce it? | Committed reference bundle and source-bound byte comparison | Make a review repeatable with the same data and rules |
| Did an optimization change the answer? | Indexed execution compared with a full-scan path | Check that performance changes preserve results for tested inputs |
| Does the control correctly remain quiet? | An exact zero-detection scenario with a preserved rule trace | Distinguish a valid negative result from a control that never ran |

The implemented domain is security telemetry. Applying these patterns to cost, schedule, or commercial data would require new domain contracts, scenarios, and validation; this repository does not claim those integrations or business outcomes.

**A concrete example:** the [reference report](reference/network-scan/report.md) processes seven synthetic events and produces one high-severity detection supported by five named events. Its proposed response is recorded as a simulation. The report includes the expected result, actual result, and checks a reviewer can rerun.

![SOC_Replay execution core](docs/assets/execution-core.svg)

The repository also documents a segmented physical lab. That lab is research context; the runnable demonstration uses synthetic fixtures. The Python package does not collect live telemetry, generate traffic, execute commands, or control infrastructure.

## What is in this repository

| Surface | Purpose | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replay engine | Deterministic load → compile → index → evaluate → verify pipeline | Implemented and tested |
| Scenario catalog | Exact positive, repeated-window, and zero-detection controls | Implemented and tested |
| Evidence bundles | JSON, Markdown, manifest, execution ledger, and integrity verification | Implemented and tested |
| Correctness proof | Indexed execution compared with a full-scan reference path | Implemented for maintained scenarios |
| Offline adapters | Stored and sanitized vendor telemetry normalization | Suricata EVE implemented |
| Physical lab documentation | Hardware, trust zones, monitoring, and recovery context | Installed/documented with explicit maturity labels |

## What it does not do

SOC_Replay does **not**:

- connect to sensors, firewalls, switches, hypervisors, identity providers, or endpoints;
- generate packets, payloads, exploits, or adversarial traffic;
- execute containment, account changes, or infrastructure commands;
- prove authorship, trusted time, external custody, or production telemetry origin; or
- claim that a deterministic scenario is a production detection-quality assessment.

All response objects are validation-locked to `simulated`.

## Quickstart

Use **Python 3.11–3.13**. No lab hardware, cloud account, credentials, or runtime dependencies are required. Run the commands from the repository root; installation needs access to the Python build tools.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlorianStuettgen/SOC_Replay.git
cd SOC_Replay

python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
```

Windows PowerShell (no activation required):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/FlorianStuettgen/SOC_Replay.git
cd SOC_Replay
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
```

Run the replay and verification below. In PowerShell, replace `soc-replay` with `.\.venv\Scripts\soc-replay.exe` and `python` with `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

```bash
soc-replay doctor
soc-replay run scenarios/network-scan --output build/network-scan
soc-replay verify-bundle build/network-scan --source scenarios/network-scan
python tools/verify_index_equivalence.py
```

Expected summary:

```text
doctor: PASS
replayed 7 events; detections=1
verification: PASS
bundle verification: PASS (... checks, 0 failed)
PASS network-scan: ...
```

The generated bundle is intentionally small and inspectable:

```text
build/network-scan/
├── report.json      # machine-readable evidence and per-rule traces
├── report.md        # analyst-readable evidence
└── manifest.json    # artifact hashes and execution identity
```

Use `soc-replay verify-bundle ... --verbose` for every check or `--json` for machine-readable verification output.

## See the evidence before reading the theory

A complete bundle for the maintained network-scan scenario is committed under [`reference/network-scan/`](reference/network-scan). Open the human-readable [`report.md`](reference/network-scan/report.md) first, then inspect the exact [`report.json`](reference/network-scan/report.json) and [`manifest.json`](reference/network-scan/manifest.json).

```bash
soc-replay verify-bundle reference/network-scan --source scenarios/network-scan
```

This reference bundle is checked in so a visitor can inspect a real result without installing anything. CI and the repository auditor require it to reproduce byte for byte from the maintained source scenario.

## Evidence guarantees

SOC_Replay separates different kinds of evidence instead of treating every hash as proof of everything.

| Mechanism | Establishes | Does not establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact scenario verification | Produced detections match declared counts, rules, severity, evidence events, groups, and simulated actions | Production usefulness or false-positive rate |
| Standalone bundle verification | Internal agreement among report, plan, traces, detections, actions, ledger, manifest, hashes, and byte counts | That the bundle came from a particular source directory |
| Source-bound reproduction | The supplied scenario regenerates all three bundle artifacts exactly under the installed engine | Authorship, trusted time, or independent custody |
| Differential index proof | Indexed execution matches the full-scan path for tested inputs | Independent validation of their shared evaluator or a proof over every possible input |
| Reproducible wheel check | Two clean source copies produce byte-identical wheels under the defined toolchain | Trustworthiness of the build host |

See [Evidence Bundles](docs/18-Evidence-Bundles.md), [Differential Correctness](docs/25-Differential-Correctness.md), and [Reproducible Builds](docs/27-Reproducible-Builds.md).

## Execution model

| Stage | Responsibility | Deterministic evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load | Validate and deeply freeze scenario and JSONL input | Input hashes and run ID |
| Compile | Bind accessors/operators and create candidate selectors | Rule and plan fingerprints |
| Index | Build immutable equality/tag indexes | Candidate strategy and index digest |
| Evaluate | Execute every rule, including zero-result rules | Ordered detections and rule traces |
| Verify | Compare output with exact declared contracts | Machine-readable PASS/FAIL checks |

Every stage appends a typed entry to a hash-linked execution ledger. Candidate selection can change cost but must not change detection semantics.

## Maintained scenarios

| Scenario | Purpose | Exact result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Network scan](scenarios/network-scan) | Positive correlation control | One high-severity detection backed by `net-001` through `net-005` |
| [Privileged group change](scenarios/privileged-group-change) | Nested-field control | One critical detection backed by `iam-002` |
| [Failed authentication burst](scenarios/failed-authentication-burst) | Repeated non-overlapping windows | Two medium-severity detections |
| [Approved privileged maintenance](scenarios/benign-privileged-change) | Negative control | Zero detections and a preserved zero-result trace |

## Physical lab context

The documented platform includes Qubes OS and Proxmox compute, enterprise switching and firewall appliances, SELKS/Suricata monitoring, storage, and independent console recovery. That platform is the research context for SOC_Replay, not an authority granted to the Python package.

Start with [Architecture](docs/01-Architecture.md), [Hardware](docs/02-Hardware.md), [Network Topology](docs/04-Network-Topology.md), and [Monitoring and Telemetry](docs/06-Monitoring-Telemetry.md). Capability maturity is controlled by [Implementation State](docs/14-Implementation-State.md).

## Quality gate

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check src tests tools
mypy
python -m compileall -q src tests tools
coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests -v
coverage report
python tools/validate_contracts.py
python tools/verify_index_equivalence.py
python tools/verify_deterministic_bundles.py
python tools/verify_repository.py
python tools/verify_reproducible_wheel.py
```

CI runs lint, types, tests, scenario, schema, and evidence checks on Linux with Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. The reproducible-wheel comparison and benchmark smoke test run on Python 3.13. A separate Windows/Python 3.12 job checks the committed reference and quickstart bundle. Diagnostics and generated evidence from the Linux matrix are preserved as workflow artifacts. The configured 90% coverage gate includes branch measurement; see the [current CI results](https://github.com/FlorianStuettgen/SOC_Replay/actions/workflows/ci.yml) for measured results.
