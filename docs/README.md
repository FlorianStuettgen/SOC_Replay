# SOC_Replay documentation

The version-controlled documentation is the canonical technical record. Start with [00 — Start Here](00-Start-Here.md). Wiki material is archival convenience only and must not contradict implementation state, contract versions, security boundaries, or measured evidence.

## Start by goal

| Goal | Recommended path |
| --- | --- |
| Understand the value without installation | [Two-minute review](00-Start-Here.md#two-minute-review-without-installation) → [Reference Report](../reference/network-scan/report.md) → [Implementation State](14-Implementation-State.md) |
| Review the engineering judgment | [Engineering Review](16-Engineering-Review.md) → [Architecture Decisions](17-Architecture-Decisions.md) → [Threat Model](21-Threat-Model.md) |
| Run the maintained demonstration | [Demo Playbook](15-Demo-Playbook.md) → [Scenario Format](12-Scenario-Format.md) → [Experiment Lifecycle](13-Experiment-Lifecycle.md) |
| Understand evidence integrity | [Evidence Bundles](18-Evidence-Bundles.md) → [Execution Ledger](23-Execution-Ledger.md) → [Contract Validation](24-Contract-Validation.md) |
| Review correctness and performance | [Differential Correctness](25-Differential-Correctness.md) → [Performance Methodology](26-Performance-Methodology.md) → [Reproducible Builds](27-Reproducible-Builds.md) |
| Understand the physical lab | [Architecture](01-Architecture.md) → [Hardware](02-Hardware.md) → [Network Topology](04-Network-Topology.md) → [Monitoring and Telemetry](06-Monitoring-Telemetry.md) |
| Extend the engine | [Replay Engine](11-Replay-Engine.md) → [Execution Core](22-Execution-Core.md) → [Architecture Decisions](17-Architecture-Decisions.md) → [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) |

## Numbering note

The numeric filenames preserve the original platform documentation series. The goal-based paths above select the most relevant chapters for each review; a chapter omitted from the map is still available in this directory.

## Reference evidence

The committed [`reference/network-scan`](../reference/network-scan) bundle is the fastest way to inspect a real report, trace, ledger, and manifest. CI and `tools/verify_repository.py` require it to reproduce exactly from the maintained source scenario.

## Documentation rules

1. [Implementation State](14-Implementation-State.md) controls capability maturity.
2. Deterministic replay evidence does not prove live physical behavior.
3. Standalone bundle verification proves internal consistency; source-bound verification proves reproduction from the supplied scenario under the installed engine.
4. Hashes are not signatures, and timestamps are not trusted merely because they appear in a report.
5. Historical wiki language must be corrected here before it is treated as a current project claim.
