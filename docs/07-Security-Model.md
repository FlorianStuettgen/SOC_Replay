# 07 – Security Model

EvoSec follows a multi-layered **zero-trust** security model to ensure experiments cannot compromise lab integrity.

## Core Elements

- **VLAN-based Segmentation** — isolation of honeypots, DMZ, management, sandbox  
- **AI-driven Threat Detection** — anomaly detection, real-time IDS/IPS alerts  
- **Automated Containment & Isolation** — VLAN reconfiguration, VM/container isolation, tar-pit routing  
- **SOC Integration & Logging** — centralized logging for audits, analysis, forensics  
- **Snapshots & Rollback** — revert lab environments to clean states after experiments
